# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Allan Glasier

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Friday, September 04 2020.

I am commiting to learn PHP I have been using the PHP framework Laravel for a while now but recently began to work on a site that is pure PHP, I realized I don't have the foundational knowledge. So now I'm committing the 100 days to learning the ins and outs of PHP!

### Day 1: September 04, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I am going through the PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), ended at video 10/22

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling pretty good, most of the stuff we are going through is mostly a refresher for me.

### Day 2: September 05, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I am going through the PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), ended at video 12/22

**Thoughts:** Did not get to work as much as I had hoped today, family events kept me occupied.

### Day 3: September 06, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I am going through the PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), ended at video 17/22

**Thoughts:** Struggled with Laragon's email sender, for some reason it will not accept my password for my gmail account. This help me up for quite some time before moving on to uploading the php file to a hosting account which then sent the form successfully.

### Day 4: September 07, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I finished PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn)

**Thoughts:** This tutorial series helped a ton, learned a lot and am on to building a couple projects to solidify the knowledge!
