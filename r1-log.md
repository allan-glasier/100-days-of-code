# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Allan Glasier

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Friday, September 04 2020.

I am commiting to learn PHP I have been using the PHP framework Laravel for a while now but recently began to work on a site that is pure PHP, I realized I don't have the foundational knowledge. So now I'm committing the 100 days to learning the ins and outs of PHP!

### Day 1: September 04, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I am going through the PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), ended at video 10/22

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling pretty good, most of the stuff we are going through is mostly a refresher for me.

### Day 2: September 05, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I am going through the PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), ended at video 12/22

**Thoughts:** Did not get to work as much as I had hoped today, family events kept me occupied.

### Day 3: September 06, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I am going through the PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), ended at video 17/22

**Thoughts:** Struggled with Laragon's email sender, for some reason it will not accept my password for my gmail account. This help me up for quite some time before moving on to uploading the php file to a hosting account which then sent the form successfully.

### Day 4: September 07, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I finished PHP Front To Back series from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn)

**Thoughts:** This tutorial series helped a ton, learned a lot and am on to building a couple projects to solidify the knowledge!

### Day 5: September 08, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today, I started to work on a task list project. I was able to create the front-end part but wanted to use firebase for the backend. This lead me to trying out google cloud as a hosting platform which came with its own set of headaches! Only because this is all new to me. I was able to get my site going thanks to [StuffedBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9EWSLmozKg)

**Thoughts:** StuffedBox helped out a ton in getting my site going. The issues came from trying to set up a subdomain. This is not as straight-forward as I am used with traditional hosting. Tomorrow I will sort that out.

### Day 6: September 09, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I figured out how to get the subdomain to work, hook up firebase and read data from the DB and integrate it with my code. Tomorrow's goals are to add the ability to add, update and delete data.

**Thoughts:** What at first seemed like a daunting task actually turned out to be pretty easy, Google cloud is actually very easy to work with once you play around with it a little bit. Feeling proud I got my database and php code linked together on my own and looking forward to tomorrow!

### Day 7: September 10, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today was a setback, I mistakenly updload my ssh key to git hub and my google cloud account got hacked forcing me to start from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Definitely learned to triple check my gitignores and silver lining is at least I'll be more familiar with the set up second time around!

### Day 8: September 11, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I got my site back up and connected with firebase. I figured out how to create, read, update, and delete.

**Thoughts:** Today was very productive, feel much more comfortable with google cloud and how to communicate with firebase.

### Day 9: September 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I had an urgent project to take care of, so need to put PHP on hold and run through a Gatsby refresher. Going through [Coding Addict's Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mam9NuxwQc&t=4663s)

**Thoughts:** John Smilga's course is amazing. He takes you through a barebones template and shows you what plugins to add and when you need them. He also is very thoruough in his explaining what he is doing. I've been through this once when initially learning Gatsby, and it is still great the second time.

### Day 10: September 13, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continued [Coding Addict's Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mam9NuxwQc&t=4663s)

**Thoughts:** Did not get as much time to sit and watch the video today as I had hoped

### Day 13: September 16, 2020
